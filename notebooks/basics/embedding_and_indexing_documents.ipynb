We will use the `text-embedding-3-small` model from OpenAI to embed the documents and the Qdrant to index the documents, then we will search for similar documents to a sample query in the indexed documents."

I think This because kids want to have their cell phones out any ways. We also have our cell phones out even if the rule isn't passed. Cell phones basically is what the world revolves around. Everybody and their mamas have a cell phone. This generation is all about technology.\\n\\nI know that you are probably thinking that we are going to do things that we are not supposed to be doing, but we do it anyways so why not just let us do it in the open. I personally don't see why the rule says that we can't have them out it will benefit us also. I do understand why you wouldn't let us have them out because you think that we are going to have it out during class and stuff. Well why punish us all for what a couple of people who got caught did. Why not just take the privilege away from them and not everybody? This school I know can do it. We have been trustworthy school. Think you should take this letter into consideration and let us use our cell phones during lunch and free time. And hey if it isn't a push maybe you could consider us using them all day, but i doubt that. I think it will be a helpful thing plus useful and fun at the same time!\\n\\nLove,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME      \"}, vector=None, shard_key=None),\n",

These would be convenient times to be able to use our phones and possibly could help with texting in class too.\\n\\nHave your parents ever needed to contact you in a bad predicament? Sometimes accidents happen and your guardians may need to speak with you for your safety. If you will not allow students to have their phones at school they could be put in danger. There have been days I have gotten sick walking home and needed to call my mom to tell her, if I did not have my phone I could not let her know. Sometimes having a cell phone on you is better for your invulnerability or health.\\n\\nMost of my friends sit at a different table than me at lunch and there are times I need too tell them something or ask them a question. The thing with our school is you have assigned tables at lunch that you sit at with your class. On more than one occasion I have needed to speak with one of my friends that sits clear across the room from me and had no way to do so with out getting in trouble. We should be able to text at lunch at least.\\n\\nThis could, in the end, help with texting in class. If there was a time we were authorized to text freely it could get it out of our systems before we return to class. This would mean less to say or speak casually about during instruction time. I am sure many people would agree with me on this subject and this is a win-win situation. When we can have our phones could revolutionize how we learn, starting in SCHOOL_NAME.\\n\\nYour student,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME'}, vector=None, shard_key=None),\n",
       " ScoredPoint(id=23, version=0, score=0.13250225290034304, payload={'text': 'Dear Principal,\\n\\nThe policy that I think that policy 1 is better is because if you ban phones from school then students will just bring them anyway. If they bring them to school they will use them because they will feel like they are just breaking the rules and that they are cool. Also students don\\'t use their phones put side of class (like in the hallway) so much so they do during class.\\n\\nSome reasons that would use them during of class is because they think that they are cool of they text during class. But the reality is if they could use them during lunch and free time then they are less likely to use them during class. If they can\\'t bring them to school then they will use them even more during class. I see it every day in our school since we are not aloud to bring them people trying to hid the fact that they are texting during class, but then they get their phone taken away then they blame they teacher.\\n\\nIf you let students use their phones in the hallway then maybe their would be less fights. The reason I think that is because they would be so focused on their phones that yes they have a bigger possibly of being late but they won\\'t notice the other students as much. But the down side of that is that if they are planing it then they can text people and say \"come watch us fight\" or something like that. But if people know about the fight then maybe they can try and stop it before it happens.\\n\\nThey can maybe show a teacher and have them separate them before it happens.\\n\\nThe last part I have to say is please pick policy 1. This way the students can feel more mature because they can have their phones and don\\'t really have to hide it. We really want to use our phones during lunch and we are not aloud to and we are really tired of it. So I say policy 1, I can get a lot of students that are behind me on that one. The teachers don\\'t have to wonder if we are texting because if we are aloud to during lunch then we won\\'t during class. We can get a lot of texts in during lunch, so if we text in the hall and during lunch then we can probably wait and not text during class unless it is an emergency.\\n\\nIf you do choose policy 2 then you are going to have a lot more people that text during class and get their phones taken. If that happens then more parents are going to come and then you will have to deal with them. I know I have gotten my phone taken because it feel out of my pocket. I had it because it was the only way my mom would know when to pick me up after the football game. I was supposed to call her, but could I now? No, it had fallen out and then I didn\\'t get it back so I had to miss the game.\\n\\nSo in conclusion, policy 1 is the better choice.\\n\\nSo I really hope you will chose this one, you will get more students that like this one then policy 2.\\n\\nThank you for reading this,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME'}, vector=None, shard_key=None)]"
